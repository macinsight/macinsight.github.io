## What this is

This will be me working through the book "Ansible for DevOps" and writing down the progress.
This will probably turn into a series, I plan to write one blog post every week or so, whenever I have time.

## Why this is

I've decided to work through Jeff Geerlings' "Ansible for DevOps"-Book to deepen my knowledge of Ansible.
Not much of a writer, but I'll document everything (And possible snags I encounter) here for future reference.

## What Ansible is
Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies complex tasks, allowing you to manage and orchestrate your infrastructure efficiently.
"Ansible for DevOps" by Jeff Geerling is a highly acclaimed book that provides a hands-on approach to learning Ansible, making it an ideal companion for both beginners and seasoned professionals.

In short, it allows you to efficiently manage and use a single or a fleet of servers as they were designed to be: _Cattle, not pets._
